# 🍔 Swiggy Data Analysis Project

This project explores customer ordering patterns and food trends using a Swiggy dataset. We use Python and Jupyter Notebook to clean, analyze, and visualize the data to uncover meaningful insights.

## 📌 Highlights

- ✅ Cleaned and preprocessed raw data
- 📊 Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- 📈 Visualized food delivery trends
- 🧠 Identified high-demand cuisines, cities, and order times

---

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries Used

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 📥 Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sonusinha1707/Swiggy_Analysis.git
cd Swiggy_Analysis
```

### ▶️ Open the Notebook

You can run the `Swiggy.ipynb` file in:

- Jupyter Notebook / JupyterLab
- VS Code with Python extension

---

## 📈 Sample Insights (Based on EDA)

- 🌆 **Top Cities**: Found cities with the highest number of orders
- 🍲 **Popular Cuisines**: Identified the most frequently ordered food types
- ⏰ **Peak Order Times**: Analyzed time slots with maximum activity
- 💰 **High-Revenue Sources**: Highlighted key contributors to total orders
